                <p>Football (or soccer as the game is called in some parts of the world) has a long history.
                Football in its current form arose in England in the middle of the 19th century.
                But alternative versions of the game existed much earlier and are a part of the football history.
                Soccer is one of the oldest sports in history. 
                Dating back to 206 B.C., there are accounts of Chinese soldiers playing Tsu'chu, “kicking the ball,” 
                to supplement their training regiments during the Han Dynasty.

        <h3>These are the Positions available</h3>
        <div class="available">
            <div class="defence">
                <h4>Defence</h4>
                <p>The defender positions in soccer play closest to their own goal and 
                are tasked with stopping the other team from scoring. Defenders must be strong and aggressive. 
                They don't need to dribble as well as other positions, so if you aren't confident with your footwork
                we recommend this position!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="midfield">
                <h4>MidField</h4>
                <p>Midfielders arguably have the most possession during a game, 
                and thus they are some of the fittest players on the pitch. Midfielders are often assigned 
                the task of assisting forwards in order to create scoring chances. If you have a lot of stamina and don't mind running
                this position is great for you!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="offence">
                <h4>Offence</h4>
                <p>Forwards, or strikers, are the primary attackers and play closest to the opponent's goal. 
                Their main objective is to score as often as possible. 
                They are usually the quickest on the field and must have exceptional ball control. I recommend this 
                position to anyone who is confident in their Soccer abilities!</p>
